<ul>
  <li>@signalk-alarm-silencer: To silence Notifications on the server. This enables Kip to instruct the SignalK server to silence said alarm for on all devices supporting SignalK Notifications, else Kip will be silenced.</li>
  <li>@signalk/signalk-autopilot: required for the N2k Autopilot to function.<br/><b>Use the Kip N2k autopilot at your own risk. Use with caution and constant supervision.</b></li>
</ul>

  <h2>Unlocking</h2>
  <p>
    KIP is "Locked" by default. This is to prevent accidental interaction from touch screens from changing anything.
    You can unlock KIP using the hamburger icon in the lower right corner and selecting "Configuration -> Edit Layout". Go Ahead try it now!
  </p>

<div *ngIf="unlockStatus">
  <h2>Configuring</h2>
  <p>
    Now that KIP is unlocked, you can do a few actions.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The icon in the lower right can be used to select the Widget you would like to display</li>
    <li>The icon in the lower left can be used to "split" the existing area. You can use this to display multiple items on one page</li>
    <li>The "X" in the upper right can be used to delete an area (basically undoing a split)</li>
    <li>Once a widget is selected, there will be a gear in the lower middle. Clicking it will allow you to setup the widget parameters</li>
  </ul>
